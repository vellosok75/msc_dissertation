## Abstract
Beam accumulation into the SIRIUS storage ring occurs in the off-axis scheme, for which the efficiency depends on a sufficiently large dynamic aperture (DA) - the region comprising stable transverse oscillations. In the design phase, SIRIUS DA was numerically optimized in the accelerator model using various techniques, and during commissioning, the optimized lattice was implemented in the machine. Recent measurements indicate that SIRIUS DA, although sufficiently large for good injection efficiency, can be increased further upon fine-tuning of sextupole magnet strengths, which govern the beam nonlinear dynamics and determine the DA. Additionally, growing interest in operating in different optics working points, where the DA is usually deteriorated, requires online optimization work to achieve acceptable injection efficiencies for operation. In this master's project, the student studied and implemented in Python the Robust Conjugate Direction Search Algorithm (RCDS) and carried out online optimization experiments using it to tune the ring nonlinear lattice to improve the DA and the efficiency of beam injection into the storage ring in different machine working points. The method improved the injection efficiency and dynamic aperture of the ring as well as allowed for a new machine working point, with enhanced orbit stability. The results highlight the efficiency of online optimization in 4th-generation storage rings.
