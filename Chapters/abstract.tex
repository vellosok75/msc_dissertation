    Beam accumulation into the SIRIUS storage ring occurs in the off-axis scheme, for which the efficiency depends on a sufficiently large dynamic aperture (DA) - the region comprising stable transverse oscillations. In the design phase, SIRIUS DA was numerically optimized in the accelerator model using various techniques and during commissioning the optimized lattice was implemented in the machine. Recent measurements indicate that SIRIUS DA, although sufficiently large for an injection efficiency of around 85\%, can be yet increased upon fine-tuning of sextupole magnets strengths, which govern the beam nonlinear dynamics and determine the DA. In this master's project, the student will carry out online optimization experiments to tune the ring nonlinear lattice and improve the DA and injection efficiency into the storage ring.
