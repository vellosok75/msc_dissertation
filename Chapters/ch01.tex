\section{Storage ring-based synchrotron light sources}
Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won
their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.
During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret
plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the DEATH STAR,
an armored space station with enough power to destroy
an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire's sinister
agents, Princess Leia races home aboard her starship,
custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people
and restore freedom to the galaxy \cite{bib_skywalker77, bib_vader77, bib_kenobi77}.
