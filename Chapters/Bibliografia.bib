@book{lee_accelerator_2004,
	title = {Accelerator {Physics}},
	isbn = {978-981-256-182-4},
	abstract = {The development of high energy accelerators began in 1911, when Rutherford discovered the atomic nuclei inside the atom. Since then, progress has been made in the following: (1) development of high voltage dc and rf accelerators, (2) achievement of high field magnets with excellent field quality, (3) discovery of transverse and longitudinal beam focusing principles, (4) invention of high power rf sources, (5) improvement of high vacuum technology, (6) attainment of high brightness (polarized/unpolarized) electron/ion sources, (7) advancement of beam dynamics and beam manipulation schemes, such as beam injection, accumulation, slow and fast extraction, beam damping and beam cooling, instability feedback, etc.The impacts of the accelerator development are evidenced by the many ground-breaking discoveries in particle and nuclear physics, atomic and molecular physics, condensed matter physics, biomedical physics, medicine, biology, and industrial processing.This book is intended to be used as a graduate or senior undergraduate textbook in accelerator physics and science. It can be used as preparatory course material for graduate accelerator physics students doing thesis research. The text covers historical accelerator development, transverse betatron motion, synchrotron motion, an introduction to linear accelerators, and synchrotron radiation phenomena in low emittance electron storage rings, introduction to special topics such as the free electron laser and the beam-beam interaction. Attention is paid to derivation of the action-angle variables of the phase space, because the transformation is important for understanding advanced topics such as the collective instability and nonlinear beam dynamics. Each section is followed by exercises, which are designed to reinforce the concept discussed and to solve a realistic accelerator design problem.},

It is much more robust against noise than traditional algorithms and is therefore suitable for online application.

By generating vertical dispersion with chromatic skew quadrupoles, a measurable chromatic function dependence on harmonic sextupoles can be observed on hybrid dispersive orbits.

	abstract = {The measured response matrix giving the change in orbit at beam position monitors (BPMs) with changes in steering magnet excitation can be used to accurately calibrate the linear optics in an electron storage ring [1--8]. A computer code called LOCO (Linear Optics from Closed Orbits) was developed to analyze the NSLS X-Ray Ring measured response matrix to determine: the gradients in all 56 quadrupole magnets; the calibration of the steering magnets and BPMs; the roll of the quadrupoles, steering magnets, and BPMs about the electron beam direction; the longitudinal magnetic centers of the orbit steering magnets; the horizontal dispersion at the orbit steering magnets; and the transverse mis-alignment of the electron orbit in each of the sextupoles. Random orbit measurement error from the BPMs propagated to give only $0.04\% rms error in the determination of individual quadrupole gradients and 0.4 mrad rms error in the determination of individual quadrupole rolls. Small variations of a few parts in a thousand in the quadrupole gradients within an individual family were resolved. The optics derived by LOCO gave accurate predictions of the horizontal dispersion, the beta functions, and the horizontal and vertical emittances, and it gave good qualitative agreement with the measured vertical dispersion. The improved understanding of the X-Ray Ring has enabled us to increase the synchrotron radiation brightness. The LOCO code can also be used to find the quadrupole family gradients that best correct for gradient errors in quadrupoles, in sextupoles, and from synchrotron radiation insertion devices. In this way the design periodicity of a storage ring's optics can be restored. An example of periodicity restoration will be presented for the NSLS VUV Ring. LOCO has also produced useful results when applied to the ALS storage ring [8].},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the brightness and coherence properties of radiation from storage rings and free electron lasers (FELs). Starting from the statistical optics and using mutual coherence function of the radiation ﬁeld, we deﬁne the transverse and temporal coherence and modes. Spectral brightness can be represented in radiation phase-space via the Wigner function which is the Fourier transformation of the transverse correlation function. The brightness convolution theorem can be employed to calculate the total source brightness and the degree of transverse coherence of the radiation emitted by an electron beam. Undulator radiation possesses partial transverse coherence until the beam emittances can be reduced below the diffraction limit. For x-ray FELs the radiation has excellent transverse coherence and at least 9 orders of magnitude enhancement in peak brightness. Seeding can further improve temporal coherence of FELs. Future development includes diffraction limited light sources, higher peak and average power x-ray FELs and compact coherent radiation sources based on laser and plasma accelerators.},

	abstract = {This article examines how major types of scientific facilities, namely synchrotrons, and the research they enable, are diffused through a dialectic between the international and national levels. This circulation is particularly marked by the transition from one generation of facility to another. Synchrotrons illustrate an internationalization model that is neither that of the concentration of research in one single device in the world, nor that of a device that adapts to multiple uses due to the activities of communities at the interstices of science, technology, industry and politics, but that of facilities that multiply through the gradual attraction of new user communities. Scientists encourage this development by working between the national and international levels, to the point where the difficulties of international cooperation, such as communication problems, isolation, and conflicts between representatives of different nationalities, are erased.},

Additionally, the optimisation increased the momentum acceptance of the lattice, increasing beam lifetime.},

	abstract = {The goal of the NSLS-II online optimization project is to improve the beam quality for the user experiments. To increase the beam lifetime and injection efficiency, we have developed a model-independent online optimization of nonlinear beam dynamics using advanced algorithms, such as Robust Conjugate-Gradient Algorithm (RCDS). The optimization objective is the injection efficiency and optimization variables are the sextupole magnet strengths. Using the online optimization technique, we increased the NSLSII dynamic aperture and reduced the amplitude-dependent tune shift. Recently, the sextupole optimization was successfully applied to double the injection efficiency up to above 90\% for the high-chromaticity lattice being developed to improve the beam stability and to increase the single-bunch beam intensity. Minimizing the beam perturbation during injection is the second objective in this project, realized by online optimization of the injection kickers. To optimize the full set of kicker parameters, including the trigger timing, amplitude, and pulse width, we upgraded all kicker power supplies with the capability of tunable waveform width. As a result, we have reduced the injection transient by a factor of 29, down to the limit of 60 μm.},
