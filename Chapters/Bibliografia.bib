@book{lee_accelerator_2004,
	title = {Accelerator {Physics}},
	isbn = {978-981-256-182-4},
	abstract = {The development of high energy accelerators began in 1911, when Rutherford discovered the atomic nuclei inside the atom. Since then, progress has been made in the following: (1) development of high voltage dc and rf accelerators, (2) achievement of high field magnets with excellent field quality, (3) discovery of transverse and longitudinal beam focusing principles, (4) invention of high power rf sources, (5) improvement of high vacuum technology, (6) attainment of high brightness (polarized/unpolarized) electron/ion sources, (7) advancement of beam dynamics and beam manipulation schemes, such as beam injection, accumulation, slow and fast extraction, beam damping and beam cooling, instability feedback, etc.The impacts of the accelerator development are evidenced by the many ground-breaking discoveries in particle and nuclear physics, atomic and molecular physics, condensed matter physics, biomedical physics, medicine, biology, and industrial processing.This book is intended to be used as a graduate or senior undergraduate textbook in accelerator physics and science. It can be used as preparatory course material for graduate accelerator physics students doing thesis research. The text covers historical accelerator development, transverse betatron motion, synchrotron motion, an introduction to linear accelerators, and synchrotron radiation phenomena in low emittance electron storage rings, introduction to special topics such as the free electron laser and the beam-beam interaction. Attention is paid to derivation of the action-angle variables of the phase space, because the transformation is important for understanding advanced topics such as the collective instability and nonlinear beam dynamics. Each section is followed by exercises, which are designed to reinforce the concept discussed and to solve a realistic accelerator design problem.},

Producing the optimum design and achieving the best performance for an accelerator depends on a detailed understanding of many (often complex and sometimes subtle) effects that determine the properties and behavior of the particle beam. Beam Dynamics in High Energy Particle Accelerators provides an introduction to the concepts underlying accelerator beam line design and analysis, taking an approach that emphasizes the elegance of the subject and leads into the development of a range of powerful techniques for understanding and modeling charged particle beams.},

	title = {Brightness and {Coherence} of {Synchrotron} {Radiation} and {FELs}},
	abstract = {This paper reviews the brightness and coherence properties of radiation from storage rings and free electron lasers (FELs). Starting from the statistical optics and using mutual coherence function of the radiation ﬁeld, we deﬁne the transverse and temporal coherence and modes. Spectral brightness can be represented in radiation phase-space via the Wigner function which is the Fourier transformation of the transverse correlation function. The brightness convolution theorem can be employed to calculate the total source brightness and the degree of transverse coherence of the radiation emitted by an electron beam. Undulator radiation possesses partial transverse coherence until the beam emittances can be reduced below the diffraction limit. For x-ray FELs the radiation has excellent transverse coherence and at least 9 orders of magnitude enhancement in peak brightness. Seeding can further improve temporal coherence of FELs. Future development includes diffraction limited light sources, higher peak and average power x-ray FELs and compact coherent radiation sources based on laser and plasma accelerators.},

	abstract = {Experimental x-ray techniques that benefit from the great increase in brightness and coherent flux provided by the fourth generation of synchrotron light sources, based on recent advances in accelerator design and technology, are widely expanding nowadays. The basic ingredient to higher brightness is a further reduction of the electron beam emittance in storage rings dedicated to light sources. However, to fully explore the potential of these new sources, it is necessary to optimize other variables as well, such as the proper matching of electrons and photons phase-space and the possibility of using new kinds of insertion devices. Equally important is to try new ways to improve the integration between the light source capabilities and the experiment needs. In this work, recent progress of low emittance rings will be reviewed and the efforts to improve transverse coherent flux and source-tobeamline integration at the Brazilian Sirius project will be described.},
